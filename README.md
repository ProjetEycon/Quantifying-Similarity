## Introduction:

Welcome to the GitHub repository of the Eycon project - a platform for historical image research and analysis based on similarity calculation!

One of the goal of Eycon to facilitate the discovery of similar images within vast collections of historical data. Whether you are a researcher, archivist, historian, or a passionate history enthusiast, Eycon offers you an advanced solution to explore and analyze historical image collections with enhanced efficiency and accuracy.

## Training Configuration
The models were trained using the PyTorch library, which provides optimal flexibility and efficiency for deep learning. We utilized PyTorch to define the model architecture, set hyperparameters, and carry out the training process.
## Hardware Specifications
The model was trained on a powerful system equipped with an NVIDIA V100-SXM2-32GB graphics card. This cutting-edge graphics card offers exceptional computing performance, accelerating the training process and enabling exploration of complex model architectures.

## Repository Contents
The repository contains the source code of the trained models, along with the training scripts used to reproduce the results.

## How to Use This Repository:
You can use the trained models to make predictions on new data or fine-tune them for specific problems using your own datasets. To initiate the vectorization of your dataset, use the "vectorisations.py" script. This will create our matrix of visual and textual features.
